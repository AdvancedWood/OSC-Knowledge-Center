## Abstract

Knowledge management (KM) plays a key role in leveraging benefits of offsite construction (OSC) by improving collaboration and knowledge reuse from previous successful OSC projects and promoting the automation of OSC processes in the future. However, there is still no study to review the current research on KM for OSC. In this paper, we conducted a systematic review to explore and expand the current best knowledge of KM for OSC from a comprehensive perspective. Specifically, we explored:

(1) What are the state-of-the-art approaches of knowledge management for offsite construction?
(2) What are the key knowledge domains that need to be managed for offsite projects?
(3) What are the research gaps and opportunities of knowledge management for OSC?

By using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology, 66 screened and assessed journal articles from all years to 2024 were included. These papers were then analysed through a mixed method, including chronological distribution analysis, keyword co-occurrence analysis and template analysis.

The outcomes reported in this paper holds promises for extending the current knowledge and gaining a systematic understanding of KM for OSC. In details, the results are summarised and discussed comprehensively to shed light on three aspects: (1) the state-of-the-art KM approaches for OSC, (2) the key OSC knowledge domains for succeeding in projects, and (3) the research gaps and future opportunities in this area. Additionally, according to the discussion, this review also indicates that emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have markable potential to promote KM for automatic OSC processes, which can be referred to drive the future research efforts.
