title: Guidance of the Knowledge Base System for Offsite Construction
weight: 1
---

By using this prototype system, you can learn related knowledge and explore any reusable cases of inter-module connection design based on the given project context. There are three tasks for this trial: **Task 1** for asking general questions OSC; **Task 2** for getting recommended design cases; and **Task 3** for exploring more details of these cases based on the system responses, such as configuration of specific design options.

## Task 1: Ask general questions

In this task, you can get familiar with offsite construction (OSC) by asking some general questions. For example, at user page, you can simply ask in the chat box at bottom and click “![send.png](img/send.png)” on the right.

(1) *How much time can be saved by using modular construction method?*

Then, you will get similar response shown in Figure 3. Referred knowledge sources will also be provided for reliability concerns. You can also modify the relevance of referred knowledge sources to be retrieved.
